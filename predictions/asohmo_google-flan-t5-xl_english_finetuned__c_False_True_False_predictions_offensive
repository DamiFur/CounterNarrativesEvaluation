	 I'm not sure if you're trying to be snarky or if you just want to make a point. I think you're making a point that illegal immigration is a problem for Hispanian people, African Americans, and the rest of us. It's not a problem only for them, it's for all of us. I don't think it's a problem primarily for them, but for everyone. It doesn't matter who you are, where you're from, what you look like, what you believe in, what you're a part of, what you don't believe in, where you come from, or what you do for a living. If you care about those things, you shouldn't be complaining about them. You should be focusing on what you can do to make things better for them. That's what you should be doing, not complaining about what you can't do.

You don't have to be a racist, or sexist, or racist, or anything like that. You can be a human being, and you don't need to be racist, or any other kind of racist. You just need to be tolerant, and you need to be accepting, and you just need to accept that you're not going to get everything you want, but you're going to have to deal with it, and you're gonna have to accept it, and that's what you're doing right now.

	 I don't understand what you are trying to say. Are you trying to say that there should be a rtd judge in every state in India? That's not what I'm saying. What I'm trying to say is that there should not be a judge at every state, but that a judge should be in every state, and that he or she should visit every state and visit every state's camps, and ensure that all illegal migrants and people with expired visas are deported.
