	 if you don't think it's a good idea to stop immigrants, you're missing the point. xenophobia is a huge problem in Europe, and it's not just a problem with immigrants. In fact, it's an entire continent that's been invaded by immigrants, and that's why we're trying to stop them. It's not a bad idea to stop immigration, but it isn't a good way to do it, because you're just letting people who don't want to assimilate into your society come in. That's why it's important to make sure that people who do want to come in are assimilated into your society, and not letting them come in because they don't agree with you. That doesn't mean you have to accept them, but it does mean that you shouldn't allow them to come in, and that you should make sure that they're not assimilating into your society. If you're going to let them come in, you should at least make sure that you're making sure that they are assimilating into your society before letting them in. And if you're not sure how to do that, maybe you should just not let them
