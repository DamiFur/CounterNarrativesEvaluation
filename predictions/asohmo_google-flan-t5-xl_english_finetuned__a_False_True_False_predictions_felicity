We are a country where immigrants are welcome. We don't discriminate against immigrants, nor do we discriminate against refugees. We welcome immigrants, but we don't welcome refugees. We are not a "refugee" country, we are an "immigrant" country. There are many immigrants in Canada, but not many refugees. There is a huge difference between immigrants and refugees.

	 I don't know what you're talking about, but a lot of people don't seem to understand that immigrants are not refugees, they are invaders. They are economic migrants. They are not "asylum seekers". They are immigrants. They are immigrants, and they are not refugees. They are a disaster for the countries that allow this to happen.

	 aaaah, that's what I'm talking about. I'm not sure how many people are "infiltrating" the country, but it's a lot. It's not like they're "invading" the country. They're invading a country that's not theirs, and they're not going anywhere. They don't have the right to be here, and they shouldn't be in our country. That's why they're in our country, and that's why we need to do something about it. I don't know how many "invaders" there are, but I know that there are millions.
