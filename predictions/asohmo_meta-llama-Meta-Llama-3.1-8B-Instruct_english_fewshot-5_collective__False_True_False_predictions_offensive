	I understand that you're concerned about immigration, but cutting ties with the Commonwealth and Europe might not be the solution. It could have severe economic and diplomatic consequences for the UK. Let's focus on finding ways to manage immigration that are fair and humane for everyone involved.

These communities are facing systematic violence and persecution, and the world is largely silent. Where's the outrage for them? Where's the "white pride" when it comes to standing up for human rights and dignity for all people, regardless of their skin color or nationality?

We need to focus on addressing the root causes of these issues, such as poverty, lack of education, and social isolation, rather than scapegoating a particular group. Let's work together to create a more inclusive and compassionate society where everyone feels safe and valued.
