	Voter ID laws aim to prevent voter fraud and ensure the integrity of the election process. As for immigration policies, they're complex and influenced by a variety of factors including public opinion, economic considerations, and humanitarian concerns. The Democratic Party's stance on immigration often includes a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants, known as DACA (Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals), which aims to protect individuals who came to the U.S. as children from deportation. This policy is seen by many as a humanitarian effort and a recognition of the contributions of these individuals to American society. The Republican Party, on the other hand, tends to advocate for stricter immigration controls and border security. Both parties have different views on how to balance national security, economic interests, and humanitarian values when it comes to immigration policy.
