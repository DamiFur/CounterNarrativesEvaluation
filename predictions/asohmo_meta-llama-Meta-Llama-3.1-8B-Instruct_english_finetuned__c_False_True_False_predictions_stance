	It's not true that illegals have no rights. In fact, the SC has established that they have some, but not all, rights. For example, they have the right to an attorney in deportation proceedings, and the government has to treat them humanely. As for education, it's not a constitutional right, but all children, regardless of their immigration status, have a right to a decent education under the 14th Amendment.

	Who are the puppets? The financial establishment? It sounds like you are talking about the people you do not agree withpolitically, but that is not the same as being a puppet.And why would a Europe with immigrants be a Europe with slaves? That is ridiculous, there is no logical connection between the two.And what is a "refugeelover"? Are you insinuating that caring for refugees is a bad thing? That should not be up for discussion, caring for people in need is a human duty.

	I don't think there is any kind of immigrant that is not "illegal" to the eyes of the law. That is why they are called "undocumented".As for the rest, I have no idea why you would say something like that. Is it because you are against immigration? Or maybe because you are xenophobic? I don't know, but I don't think it's a good idea to make up stories about people you don't know just to justify your prejudices.

	It is not true that immigrants bring crime to America. In fact, the opposite is true: the less immigrant a country has, the more crime it has. This is because immigrants are less likely to commit crimes, and also because the correlation between immigration and crime is negative: when there are no immigrants, there is only one culture, and when there are many immigrants, there are many cultures, and crime decreases.
