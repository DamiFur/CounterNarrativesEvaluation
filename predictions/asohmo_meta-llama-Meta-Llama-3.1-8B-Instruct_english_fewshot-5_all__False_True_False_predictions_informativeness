	Let's look at the actual numbers: $135 billion in costs vs. $8 billion in taxes. That's a net loss of $127 billion. However, what about the economic benefits that aren't easily quantifiable, like the contributions of undocumented immigrants to the workforce, the stimulation of local economies, and the cultural richness they bring?
