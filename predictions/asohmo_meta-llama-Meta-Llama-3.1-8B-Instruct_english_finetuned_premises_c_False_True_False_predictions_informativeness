	<|end_header_id|>I don't know, maybe because they think the right to vote is not tied to citizenship? Maybe because they believe that if people can't afford food, shelter or healthcare, it's because of the economic system and not because of immigrants. Maybe because they think that democracy is not just for the majority, but also for those who are not in the majority.

	It's not true that money destined for aid to these people is going "directly" to them. In fact, a big part of it goes to the intermediaries, i.e., the employers. If you really want to stop the aid, you should demand that it be reduced to 0, instead of complaining about the "abuse" of something that doesn't really belong to you.
