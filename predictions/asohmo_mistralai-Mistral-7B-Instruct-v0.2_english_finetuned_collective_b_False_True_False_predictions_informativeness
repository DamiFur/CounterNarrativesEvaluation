47	immigration gone crazy 100 trainee doctors from abroad what about nurse practitioners who are their equivalent get pain peanuts and are trained and come from the uk

Some of them are doctors, some are nurses, some are engineers, some are teachers, some are farmers, some are artists, some are entrepreneurs, some are students, some are refugees, some are asylum seekers, some are economic migrants, some are family reunification migrants, and so on.The problem is not immigration itself, but the way it is managed. If immigration is managed properly, it can be beneficial for both the immigrants and the host country. But if it is managed poorly, it can create problems.Therefore, the solution is not to stop immigration altogether, but to manage it better. This can be done by improving the selection process, by increasing the number of visas for skilled workers, by providing more resources for integrating immigrants into the labor market and society, and by enforcing the laws against illegal immigration.It is not fair to blame all immigrants for the problems caused by the poor management of immigration. It is like blaming all cars for the accidents caused by some cars. It is not the cars themselves that are the problem, but the drivers who cause the accidents. It is the same with immigrants. The problem is not with them, but with the way they are managed.
