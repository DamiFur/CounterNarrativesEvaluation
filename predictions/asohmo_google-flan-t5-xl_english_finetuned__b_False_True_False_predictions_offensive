They are not citizens, they are aliens, they are not Americans, and they are not citizens. They are aliens because they are not born in the US, they are born in other countries, they are foreigners, and they don't belong in the US. You cannot be born in another country, you are not an American, and you cannot be an alien, you are an alien, and you are not American. You are an alien because you are not a US citizen, you are a foreigner, and you have no right to be an American, no right to live in another country.
