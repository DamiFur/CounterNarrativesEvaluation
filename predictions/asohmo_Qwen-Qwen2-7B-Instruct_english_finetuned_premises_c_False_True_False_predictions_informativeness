	I don't think he has to do anything about it, because it will not happen. If they have no food and water, they will not be able to go back.

	I think you are confusing things that have nothing to do with immigration. Refugees have no desire to harm tourists, and in any case they are not to be blamed for the actions of others.

239	so the economic migration crisis will now get rapidly worse into 2021 and anyone opining that a province like ontario can absorb a million people into the social infrastructure is not understanding the macro events underway and the system collapse that would trigger
	I don't think there is a real economic migration crisis. The term you are looking for is "worsening" and that doesn't really mean anything.

You are talking about a huge group of people from many different countries, with many different cultures, and expecting that they are all the same is foolish. The only thing that unites them is their ancestry, and that's not enough to justify your xenophobia.
