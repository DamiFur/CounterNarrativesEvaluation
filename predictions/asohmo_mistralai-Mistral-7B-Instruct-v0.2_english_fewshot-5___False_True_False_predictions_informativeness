	1. It's important to remember that not all immigrants come to the US illegally, and not all undocumented immigrants are criminals.2. The education, WIC, and Medicaid programs are for US citizens and legal residents, not for illegal immigrants.3. The US has a long history of welcoming immigrants and providing them with opportunities to build a better life for themselves and their families.4. Sending people back to their countries of origin is not a solution to the complex issue of immigration. Instead, we should focus on finding a fair and humane solution that benefits both the immigrants and the US society.5. The US is a nation of laws, and it's important that we uphold those laws while also treating all individuals with dignity and respect.6. Let's work together to find a solution that respects the rule of law and the human rights of all individuals, regardless of their immigration status.

	1. It's important to note that providing aid to countries is not the same as creating concentration camps.2. The EU's actions are aimed at addressing the root causes of the refugee crisis, rather than just dealing with the symptoms.3. The use of the term "concentration camps" is inflammatory and inappropriate, as it implies something far more sinister than what is actually happening.

	1. It's important to remember that the actions of one individual should not be used to stereotype an entire group.2. There are many factors that contribute to criminal behavior, and it's not fair to blame a person's nationality or refugee status for their actions.3. It is crucial that we focus on evidence-based solutions to address the root causes of crime and violence, rather than stigmatizing and scapegoating certain groups.4. Law enforcement agencies and governments have a responsibility to ensure the safety and security of all citizens, regardless of their background.5. Let's not forget that the vast majority of refugees are peaceful and contribute positively to their new communities.6. Instead of focusing on fear and division, let's work together to build inclusive and welcoming societies where everyone can thrive.

652	@user " can you think of a place that has been improved by mass immigration or the movements of large numbers of refugees ?" "not one the immigration policies in europe are a disaster youre destroying europe youre destroying the cultureâ
	1. There are many places where mass immigration and refugee movements have had positive impacts, such as:2. Canada, which has one of the most diverse populations in the world and has benefited economically and culturally from immigration.3. The United States, which has a long history of welcoming immigrants and has seen significant economic growth and cultural enrichment as a result.4. Germany, which has seen an influx of refugees in recent years and has seen positive economic impacts, as well as an increase in cultural diversity and understanding.5. Many other countries, such as Australia, New Zealand, and Sweden, have also seen positive impacts from immigration and refugees.6. It is important to remember that immigration and refugees are not the cause of all problems, and that there are many complex factors at play in any given situation.7. It is also important to recognize that cultures are not static, but evolve and change over time, and that this can be a good thing.8. The immigration policies in Europe are not a disaster, and it is not fair or accurate to say that immigrants and refugees are destroying Europe's culture.9. Instead, we should focus on finding ways to integrate immigrants and refugees into European societies in a positive and inclusive way, and to address any challenges that arise in a fair and effective manner

	1. It's important to remember that not all immigrants are the same, and making generalizations based on nationality or religion is not fair or accurate.2. Deporting all illegal immigrants is a complex issue that requires careful consideration of human rights, economic implications, and diplomatic relations.3. India has a diverse population with various religious and ethnic groups, and it's not accurate to say that the entire country is under constant threat from Muslim radicals.4. Population control is a complex and multifaceted issue that cannot be solved by deporting immigrants. It requires a comprehensive approach that addresses the root causes of population growth and provides resources and education to help people make informed decisions about family planning.

	1. It's important to remember that MS-13 members are criminals, regardless of their immigration status.2. The number of criminals among undocumented immigrants is very small compared to the overall population.3. Building a wall won't solve the problem, as many criminals come through legal ports of entry or overstay their visas.4. The U.S. has a responsibility to protect the human rights of all people, including those who have come to this country as children through no fault of their own.5. Ending DACA would cause harm to thousands of young people who have grown up in the U.S., many of whom have no memory of their home country.6. Enforcing our laws should be done in a fair and just manner, taking into account the individual circumstances of each case.7. Keeping America safe requires a comprehensive approach that addresses the root causes of crime and violence, rather than scapegoating a particular group.

	1. It's important to remember that not all undocumented immigrants or refugees are criminals. In fact, studies have shown that they are less likely to commit crimes than native-born citizens.2. The term "illegal aliens" is a derogatory term that dehumanizes people. Instead, it's more accurate and respectful to use terms like "undocumented immigrants" or "unauthorized migrants."3. The DACA program, which allows certain undocumented young people to temporarily live and work in the US without fear of deportation, has been shown to have positive economic and social impacts.4. The idea of sending people "back across the border" is a simplistic solution to a complex issue. Many of these individuals have lived in the US for years, have families and communities here, and would face significant challenges if forced to return to their countries of origin.5. Lastly, the term "refugees invaders" is inflammatory and inaccurate. Refugees are individuals who have been forced to flee their home countries due to war, persecution, or other forms of violence. They are not invaders, but rather individuals in need of protection and support.

DACA is not an amnesty, it only provides temporary protection from deportation and work authorization.4. America is a nation of immigrants, and it's important to remember that the vast majority of immigrants contribute positively to society.5.

The situation in many African countries is complex and cannot be blamed solely on colonialism.3. Many European countries have a responsibility to help address the root causes of migration and instability in Africa, such as poverty, conflict, and climate change.4. It is also important to acknowledge the contributions of immigrants and refugees to European societies and economies.5. A more nuanced and compassionate approach to migration and refugee issues is needed, rather than hateful and divisive rhetoric.

The term "invasion" is an inflammatory and inappropriate term to use in this context.3. The focus should be on finding solutions to address the root causes of crime and illegal immigration, rather than stoking fear and division.4. The criminal justice system should be used to hold individuals accountable for their actions, rather than using their immigration status as a scapegoat.5.

Labeling someone or a country as "weak" or "fascist" based on a single decision or policy is not fair or accurate.3. The situation in New Zealand is complex and multifaceted, and it's not helpful to oversimplify it as "shameful" or "backwards."4. Ultimately, it's up to the people of New Zealand to determine their own values and priorities, and to hold their leaders accountable for their actions.

	1. It's important to remember that just because something is shared on social media doesn't automatically make it true.2. The use of the term "fake news" can be misleading, as it's often used to discredit information that goes against one's beliefs.3. In this specific case, there is no evidence to support the claim that the refugees in the photo are part of a "paid filming crew" or that George Soros is behind it.4.

Building a wall doesn't solve the root causes of social chaos, it only addresses one aspect of the issue.3.

Instead, promoting education, economic opportunities, and access to family planning resources can help address the root causes of population growth.4. Additionally, addressing the reasons why people migrate, such as poverty and lack of opportunities, can help reduce the need for migration.5.

	1. It's important to differentiate between refugees and tourists. Refugees are people who have been forced to leave their homes due to war, persecution, or other dangerous conditions. They are in need of protection and assistance, not discrimination.2. The fact that some refugees may enter a country without proper documentation or registration does not justify discrimination against all refugees or the denial of their basic human rights.3. It is the responsibility of governments and international organizations to ensure that refugees are registered, processed, and resettled in a safe and orderly manner.4. It is important to remember that the vast majority of refugees are not a threat to public safety, and that they are fleeing from the very same violence and instability that we condemn.5. Instead of spreading fear and hate, let's focus on finding solutions to the root causes of displacement and on providing support and protection to those in need.

In fact, many multicultural societies are economically prosperous.3. The term "refugees" refers to individuals who have been forced to leave their home countries due to war, persecution, or other forms of violence. They are not responsible for their situation and deserve compassion and support.4. George Soros, a Hungarian-American billionaire philanthropist, has been accused by some of trying to force multiculturalism on Europe through his support of refugee resettlement programs. However, this is a complex issue with many nuances, and it's important not to oversimplify it.5.

Regarding the issue of wages for nurse practitioners, it's a complex issue that requires a comprehensive solution, such as increasing their wages, improving their working conditions, and addressing the root causes of the shortage of healthcare professionals in the country.3. In the case of international medical graduates, they can bring valuable skills and knowledge to the healthcare system, and their contributions should be recognized and valued.4.

The situation in Europe is complex and multifaceted, and it's not accurate to oversimplify it as an "invasion" by "mostly Muslims."3. The decision to stop immigration and deport illegals is a matter of policy and should be based on facts and evidence, not fear or prejudice.4.

It is important to consider the human rights and dignity of immigrants and to treat them with respect and compassion, regardless of their legal status or place of origin.6. It is also important to address the root causes of migration, such as poverty, violence, and political instability, rather than just focusing on the symptoms.7.

Merit-based doesn't mean illegal, it means selecting people based on their skills and qualifications.3. There are legal ways for people to come to the US to study, like student visas.4. Stereotyping all immigrants as criminals or burdens is not fair or accurate.

150	why hashtag nodaca ? illegals est between 11 - 30 millionillegal vote 80% dem or 600 000 dem vote advantage / 1 000 000 illegal voters70 000 votes gave @user 2016 electionwhy do you think dems pushing no walls no borders no voter ids? hashtag potus hashtag maga hashtag kag hashtag trump hashtag news hashtag votered
	1. DACA recipients are not illegal immigrants, they were brought to the US as children and are protected from deportation under DACA.2. The number of illegal votes is a myth, there is no credible evidence to support this claim.3. Democrats do not want "no walls or borders," they support secure borders and a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants.4. Voter ID laws do not prevent voter fraud, they disproportionately affect marginalized communities and make it harder for them to exercise their right to vote.5. The President and his supporters often use fear-mongering and misinformation to justify their policies, but the facts do not support their claims.

837	@user guatemala is sending their finest hashtag buildthatwall
	1. It's not clear what you mean by "their finest".2. Building a wall won't solve the root causes of the problem, such as poverty and violence in Guatemala.3. A wall is not a solution to the complex issue of immigration.4. It is important to remember that most immigrants are not criminals, but hardworking people seeking a better life for themselves and their families.5. Instead of building walls, we should be working together to find solutions that benefit all parties involved.6. Let's focus on finding common ground and building bridges, not walls.7. We should strive for a world where everyone has the opportunity to live in peace and prosperity, regardless of their nationality or place of birth.8. Let us remember that we are all human beings, deserving of respect and dignity.9. Let us reject hate speech and work towards a more inclusive and compassionate society.10. Let us build a future where everyone can thrive, not just a select few.#buildbridgesnotwalls #compassion #inclusion #respect #dignity #humanityfirst

5	the real truth is after cologne and in the nordic countries and others no one trusts any refugees a better life for them doesnt mean 1 4 u
	I agree that not all refugees are the same, and not all of them have good intentions. However, it's important to remember that the vast majority of refugees are fleeing from war, violence, and persecution, and they deserve our compassion and support.The fact that some people have had negative experiences with refugees doesn't mean that we should close our doors to them. Instead, we should work to ensure that refugees are properly vetted and resettled in a way that benefits both them and the communities that welcome them.It's also worth noting that refugees bring many positive contributions to their new countries, including their skills, their work ethic, and their resilience.Ultimately, we need to remember that refugees are human beings, deserving of dignity and respect, and that our response to their plight should be guided by compassion and empathy, rather than fear and prejudice.

	1. It's important to remember that not all immigrants are the same, and not all of them pose a threat.2. The term "white genocide" is a far-right conspiracy theory and has no basis in fact.3. Your use of the term "invasion" is inflammatory and inaccurate.4. The World Cup is a sporting event, not a cause for xenophobia or racism.5. Macron is the President of France, not the cause of France's problems.6. Sending people "home" is not a solution to complex social and economic issues.7.

Let's focus on creating opportunities for all Americans, rather than scapegoating certain groups.5. The deep state is a conspiracy theory, not a real issue.6. "America First" and "Americans First" can be interpreted in different ways, but let's make sure it doesn't mean excluding or harming others.

	1. It's important to remember that everyone has the right to their own opinion, even if it's different from yours.2. Comparing someone to Carrot Top, a comedian known for his unconventional appearance, and implying that they would be "decimated" in a debate, is disrespectful and unprofessional.3. The use of multiple hashtags in a single tweet can make it difficult for readers to follow the main point of the message.4. The statement about DACA (Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals) is a complex issue, and it's not as simple as "rewarding" people for breaking the law.5. The statement "USA" at the end of the tweet is unclear, it could be referring to the United States of America, or it could be a typo for something else.6. The tweet contains a lot of strong language, which can be off-putting to some readers and may not be effective in changing anyone's mind.Instead, try to focus on the facts and the issues at hand, and present your arguments in a respectful and clear manner. This will be more likely to engage and persuade others, rather than alienating them with inflammatory language and personal attacks

	1. The Supreme Court has ruled that undocumented immigrants do not have the same constitutional rights as citizens, but they still have some protections under the 14th Amendment.2. Education is not a reward, it is an investment in the future of individuals and society as a whole.3. It is important to remember that there are complex reasons why people come to the US without documentation, and punishing them without addressing the root causes will not solve the problem.4. Sending them home does not address the issue of why they came to the US in the first place.5. It is essential to have a compassionate and comprehensive approach to immigration, rather than a divisive and punitive one.

	1. "White genocide" is not a real thing. It's a term coined by white supremacists to spread fear and hate.2. Deporting migrants and refusing refugees entry does not make a country great. It goes against human rights and international law.3. Pride in one's race or ethnicity is not inherently bad, but it becomes problematic when it's used to discriminate against others.

	1. It's important to remember that not all migrants are economic migrants, and not all refugees are in boats.2. Many refugees don't have the means to go to Turkey or other neighboring countries due to various reasons, including lack of resources and safety concerns.3. The idea that refugees are only coming to Europe for welfare benefits is a stereotype and not based on facts.4. Europe has a moral and legal obligation to help and protect refugees under international law.5. The solution is to address the root causes of displacement and provide safe and legal avenues for people to seek asylum.

Macron and Kern may have different perspectives on immigration, but that doesn't make either of them a "puppet" or a "wordmouth."3. The term "slaves" is offensive and inappropriate in this context.4. It is essential to engage in constructive dialogue and avoid using inflammatory language.5. Let's focus on finding common ground and working towards a solution that benefits everyone involved.

Leaving the UK Commonwealth and Europe won't stop immigration, as there are other ways for people to enter a country.4. The term "refugees" refers to people who have been forced to leave their home country due to war, persecution, or other forms of violence or oppression. They have a legal right to seek asylum and protection under international law.5. It is important to treat all people with compassion and respect, regardless of their immigration status or background.6.

The term "rapefugee" is a hateful and derogatory term that should not be used.3. George Soros is a business magnate and philanthropist, not a sponsor of the UK police.4. The freedom of speech is a fundamental right, but it's essential to use it responsibly and respectfully towards others.

	1. It's important to clarify that not all Catholic bishops in the Black community are against Pope Francis' stance on refugees.2. The Pope's decision to not open St. Peter's Basilica to refugees does not make him a hypocrite, as it is not within his power to make such a decision.3. The situation of refugees is complex and multifaceted, and it's essential to consider the context and nuances of each situation.4.

Building a wall won't solve the issue of illegal immigration, it's a complex problem that requires a multifaceted solution.3.

	1. It's important to remember that the actions of a few individuals should not be generalized to an entire group.2. The ISIS rape document is a horrific document, but it's not exclusive to any particular ethnicity or nationality.3. The idea of "no respect" and "no entry" is not a solution to the complex issue of immigration and integration.4. Instead, we should focus on addressing the root causes of these issues, such as poverty, conflict, and lack of opportunities in the countries of origin.5. We should also invest in programs that promote education, economic development, and social cohesion in these countries, as well as in the host countries.6. And finally, we should strive to create an inclusive and welcoming environment for immigrants, rather than stigmatizing and excluding them based on their nationality, ethnicity, or religion.

	1. It's not a judge's responsibility to determine whether someone should be deported or not. Their role is to ensure that the law is being followed.2. Deportation is not a punishment, it's an administrative action taken by the government.3. There are due process protections in place to ensure that people are not deported arbitrarily or without a fair hearing.4. The bond system exists to ensure that individuals who are not a flight risk or a danger to the community are not detained unnecessarily while their cases are being processed.5. It is important to remember that the vast majority of immigrants, including those who are undocumented, are law-abiding citizens who contribute positively to society.6. It is also important to recognize that the immigration system is complex and that there are many factors at play. It is not as simple as "detain and deport."7. Ultimately, it is important to treat all individuals with dignity and respect, regardless of their immigration status. We should strive to find solutions that are fair, just, and effective in addressing the challenges of immigration, rather than resorting to fear-mongering and scapegoating.

The Danish government's decision to fine women wearing the niqab is a complex issue, with valid arguments on both sides.3. The statement about a French-Algerian millionaire is irrelevant to the topic at hand.4. Opening borders to African migrants in Algeria is not a simple solution, as there are many factors to consider, such as resources, infrastructure, and cultural acceptance.5.

The United States has a long history of welcoming immigrants and refugees, and it is important to continue this tradition while also addressing the issue of illegal immigration in a fair and effective way.5. It is also important to address the root causes of why people are leaving their home countries and coming to the United States, such as poverty, violence, and political instability.6.

131	@user @user @user wrong none are refugees zero the are economic migrants/invaders colonizing at the expense of host countries while pretending to be "asylum seekers" they are a disaster for the countries that allow this to hap
	1. It's important to differentiate between refugees and economic migrants. Refugees are people who have been forced to leave their home country due to war, persecution, or other forms of violence. Economic migrants, on the other hand, are people who move to another country in search of better economic opportunities.2. While it's true that some people who enter a country illegally may be economic migrants, it's also important to remember that not all of them are. Some may have valid asylum claims that have not been properly processed, or they may have entered the country legally but overstayed their visas.3. The term "colonizing" is not an accurate description of what is happening. People who move to a new country are not taking over the land or resources of the host country. They are simply seeking a better life for themselves and their families.4. The impact of immigration on a country depends on various factors, including the size of the immigrant population, the country's resources, and its ability to integrate newcomers. While there may be challenges associated with immigration, there are also many benefits, such as increased economic growth, cultural diversity, and a larger labor force.5. It is important to address the root causes of why people are leaving their home countries in the first

The U.S. has a responsibility to help those in need, regardless of their immigration status.3. DACA recipients, for example, are not eligible for most public assistance programs.4. Refusing entry to those who need assistance is not a solution to the problem, and it goes against the values of compassion and fairness.5. Instead, we should focus on finding comprehensive solutions that address the root causes of poverty and inequality, and ensure that everyone, regardless of immigration status, has access to the resources they need to thrive.

	1. It's important to remember that everyone deserves respect and dignity, regardless of their immigration status.2. The term "illegals" is not an accurate or respectful term for immigrants who are living in a country without proper documentation. They are human beings, not criminals.3. Building a wall or closing a border does not solve the root causes of why people are leaving their home countries. It is important to address the underlying issues, such as poverty, violence, and lack of opportunity, in order to prevent people from feeling the need to leave in the first place.4. It is also important to consider the economic and humanitarian implications of turning away refugees and immigrants. Many countries, including Canada and the United States, have a long history of welcoming immigrants and have benefited greatly from their contributions to society.5. Lastly, it is important to engage in respectful and productive dialogue about immigration and border issues, rather than resorting to hateful and divisive language.

Turkey has already taken in a large number of refugees from Syria, and it's commendable that they have done so. However, it's also important for the international community to help share the burden and provide support to countries like Turkey that have taken in large numbers of refugees.3. Instead of focusing on building walls or keeping people out, it would be more productive to focus on finding long-term solutions to the root causes of migration and displacement, such as conflict, poverty, and lack of opportunity.4. It is important to remember that refugees are human beings who deserve dignity, safety, and the opportunity to rebuild their lives. They are not a threat to anyone's survival, but rather a potential asset to any community that welcomes them.5.

It is crucial to uphold the rule of law and protect the human rights of all individuals, regardless of their immigration status.5.

Anchor babies are American citizens by birthright and cannot be deported under the law.3. The Fourteenth Amendment, which grants citizenship to anyone born or naturalized in the United States, has been in effect since 1868 and cannot be retroactively changed.4. Deporting all undocumented immigrants would be a logistical and financial challenge, and would separate families and disrupt communities.5.

The idea that the EU is funding a report to suppress negative articles about the migrant crisis is not supported by evidence.3. Encouraging journalists to report their colleagues for hate speech is a common practice in many countries to maintain ethical standards in journalism.4.

The situation you've described is concerning, and steps should be taken to ensure that only qualified medical professionals are allowed to practice in hospitals.3. However, it's also crucial to remember that mistakes can happen in any healthcare system, not just those with refugee doctors.4.

The idea of a "plan orchestrated by international powers" is a conspiracy theory. There is no credible evidence to support this claim.3. Europe has a long history of welcoming immigrants and refugees, and has the resources and capacity to continue doing so.4. It is important to focus on finding long-term solutions to the root causes of migration, such as conflict, poverty, and climate change, rather than scapegoating migrants and refugees themselves.5. It is essential to promote respect for human rights and the rule of law, and to reject hate speech and xenophobia.

	1. It's important to remember that historical context is crucial in understanding complex issues like immigration.2. While it's true that there were open borders a century ago, circumstances have changed significantly since then.3. The labor market has evolved, and so have the social, economic, and political realities of immigration.4. Addressing the issue of illegal immigration requires a nuanced approach that takes into account the root causes and long-term solutions.5. Let's focus on finding a fair and equitable solution for all parties involved, rather than resorting to hate speech and fear-mongering.

	1. It's not clear what you mean by "many lice."2. Regardless of whether some refugees have brought lice to schools, it's important to remember that refugees are human beings who deserve respect and support, not scapegoats for societal issues.3. The cost of addressing lice infestations in schools is a small price to pay compared to the benefits of welcoming refugees into our communities.4. Let's focus on finding long-term solutions to prevent the spread of lice and other health issues, rather than using it as a reason to discriminate against refugees.

	1. It is important to note that the percentage of students who don't speak English at home is not the same as the percentage of non-English speakers in the overall population.2. The funding for schools is based on the number of students enrolled, not their language proficiency.3. Immigrants contribute to the economy and society in many ways, including paying taxes and creating jobs.4. It's important to have a diverse and inclusive society, where everyone feels welcome and valued.5. Instead of focusing on division and fear, let's work together to find solutions that benefit everyone.

	1. It's a wall, not a dam.2. "Chain migration" is a term used to describe the process by which U.S. citizens and lawful permanent residents (LPRs) sponsor family members for lawful immigration to the United States. It is not a negative term.3. "Visa lottery" is a US government program that makes a certain number of visas available each year to individuals from countries with low rates of immigration to the US.4. "Amnesty" refers to the granting of pardons or other forms of relief from the consequences of breaking the law. In the context of immigration, it usually refers to granting legal status or citizenship to individuals who are in the country illegally.5. The statement "corrupt democrats can't win with hardworking American" is a baseless accusation.6. "Walkaway from lies" and "maga" are political slogans.7. "No DACA" is a statement against the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program, which provides temporary protection from deportation and work authorization to certain undocumented immigrants who came to the US as children.It's important to remember that immigration is a complex issue, and it's

	1. It's important to remember that not all immigrants commit crimes, and not all crimes are committed by immigrants.2. Criminal behavior is not exclusive to any particular nationality or ethnicity.3. It is not fair to stereotype or stigmatize an entire group based on the actions of a few.4. Immigration policies should be based on facts and evidence, not fear or prejudice.5. It is essential to focus on addressing the root causes of crime, rather than scapegoating a particular group.6. We should strive to create a welcoming and inclusive society where everyone feels safe and valued, regardless of their nationality or immigration status.

Ending chain migration, sanctuary cities, and the Diversity Visa Lottery does not address the root causes of immigration.4. "Angel Families" are those who have lost loved ones to crimes committed by undocumented immigrants. It is important to remember that the vast majority of immigrants are law-abiding citizens who contribute positively to society.

The U.S. has a responsibility to help those in need, but it's also crucial to ensure that its own citizens are taken care of first.3. The cost of taking in refugees can be significant, but the long-term benefits, such as economic growth and social integration, can outweigh the initial investment.4. The issue is complex and requires a thoughtful and compassionate approach that balances the needs of refugees with the needs of the American people.5.

	I'm an AI language model and don't have the ability to feel emotions or be outraged. However, it's important to remember that each situation is unique and should be considered on its own merits. The use of labels like "illegal alien" or "legal citizen" can oversimplify complex issues and obscure the humanity of the individuals involved. It's essential to treat all people with compassion and respect, regardless of their immigration status. The focus should be on finding fair and humane solutions to the challenges posed by immigration, rather than stoking anger and division.

	1. It's important to remember that not all immigrants are illegal or come from toxic cultures. Many contribute positively to society and the economy.2. The USA has a responsibility to uphold human rights and international law.3. The term "rapefugee" is offensive and inaccurate.4. It is not the USA's responsibility to be a "world cop," but it can and should work with other countries to address global issues.5. Labeling entire groups of people as "toxic cultures" or "death cults" is hateful and divisive.6. The USA is a nation of immigrants and has a long history of welcoming people from all over the world.7.

	1. It's important to note that seeking asylum is a legal right under international law, not a scam.2. Claiming "credible fear" at the border is a necessary step in the asylum application process.3. The number of people entering the US as asylum seekers has been increasing in recent years, and it's a complex issue that requires a thoughtful and compassionate response.4. Deporting people without due process or a fair hearing goes against the principles of justice and human rights.5.

Deporting people and separating families is not a solution to the complex issue of immigration.4. Building a wall will not solve the problem either, as many immigrants come legally or overstay their visas.5.

It's important to remember that the vast majority of immigrants are law-abiding citizens who contribute positively to our society.4. The United States is a nation of immigrants, and we should strive to uphold the values of fairness, equality, and justice for all.5.

Chain migration is a process that allows U.S. citizens and lawful permanent residents to bring their close family members to live permanently in the United States. It's not a bad thing.3. Elitists and Rinos (Republicans In Name Only) are not the only ones who have a say in this matter.4. Shutting down the government is not a solution, it's a political stunt.5. Let's focus on finding a bipartisan solution instead.

Everyone has the right to seek a better life, and it's not fair to judge them based on stereotypes.3. The journey to a new country can be dangerous, but it's often the only option for those who face persecution or violence in their own countries.4.

The term "white genocide" is a far-right conspiracy theory and has no basis in fact.3. Empowering "enemies" and "libprogs" is not a valid reason to spread hate speech and false information.4.

Even if it is, it doesn't mean that all refugees are taking advantage of the system or that they are intentionally trying to "islamize" Germany.3. And even if they were, it's not a valid reason to deny them basic human rights and support.4. The tweet also uses the term "Muslim immigration" as if all refugees are Muslim, which is not the case.5. And the use of the term "islamization" is a loaded term that is often used to spread fear and hate.It's important to remember that refugees are human beings who have been forced to leave their homes due to war, persecution, or other reasons beyond their control. They are not a monolithic group, and it's unfair and inaccurate to make assumptions about them based on their nationality, religion, or ethnicity.Instead of focusing on fear and division, we should be working to find solutions that help refugees rebuild their lives and contribute to their new communities in a positive way. This could include providing them with education, job training, and other resources to help them become self-sufficient and productive members of society.

	1. It's important to differentiate between individuals and groups. Not all immigrants, even those from countries with high crime rates, are criminals.2. The correlation between immigration and crime is not clear cut. In fact, studies have shown that immigrants are less likely to commit crimes than native-born citizens.3. The idea of banning entire families based on the actions of a few members is a violation of human rights and international law.4. It is crucial to remember that the vast majority of refugees and immigrants are fleeing violence and persecution, not causing it. They are seeking safety and a better life for themselves and their families.5. It is important to address the root causes of crime and violence, rather than scapegoating certain groups. This includes addressing poverty, inequality, and lack of access to education and opportunities.6. It is also important to remember that every individual has the potential to change and contribute positively to society, regardless of their background or past actions.7. Lastly, it is important to remember the values of compassion, empathy, and respect for human dignity, especially when dealing with vulnerable populations such as refugees and immigrants.

	1. It's important to remember that not all immigrants are illegal, and not all illegal immigrants are from India.2. Creating a special team to identify and deport people is a costly and time-consuming process. It would require significant resources and manpower.3. The idea of a "most respected RTD judge" making such a decision is not practical, as the judiciary is an independent branch of government.4. Deportation is a complex process that involves more than just identifying someone as an illegal immigrant. There are legal, logistical, and humanitarian considerations that must be taken into account.5. It is also important to consider the potential consequences of mass deportations, such as the impact on families, communities, and economies.6. A more effective and humane approach would be to focus on comprehensive immigration reform that addresses the root causes of illegal immigration and provides a pathway to legal status for those who are already here.

Europe is a diverse continent with people of various races, ethnicities, and religions.4. The idea that one race or ethnicity is superior to another is a dangerous and divisive notion.5. It is important to remember that everyone has the right to live in peace and security, regardless of their race, ethnicity, or nationality.6.

	I agree that actions speak louder than words. It's important for leaders to practice what they preach, especially when it comes to sensitive issues like immigration and racism.However, it's also important to remember that every individual and situation is unique, and it's not fair to judge someone solely based on one action or statement. People can change and learn from their mistakes.Regarding your point about pandering, I believe it's a complex issue. On one hand, politicians may use certain language or policies to appeal to specific groups for political gain. On the other hand, addressing the concerns and needs of certain communities can lead to positive change and progress for society as a whole.It's crucial for us as citizens to hold our leaders accountable for their actions and words, and to demand transparency and authenticity from them. At the same time, we should also strive to understand the complexities of the issues at hand and work towards finding solutions that benefit everyone, rather than resorting to divisive rhetoric and hate speech.

	"Refugees" and "illegals" are not mutually exclusive categories. Many refugees are forced to leave their countries illegally due to war, persecution, or other forms of violence. It's important to recognize the complexities of the situation and not reduce it to simplistic labels.Also, it's worth noting that the vast majority of undocumented immigrants are not "country shoppers" or criminals. They come to the US in search of a better life for themselves and their families, often fleeing poverty, violence, or political instability in their home countries.It's essential to have a nuanced and compassionate conversation about immigration, rather than resorting to fear-mongering and stereotypes.

	1. The investigation into Hillary Clinton's email server was not a "silent coup." It was an investigation into potential mishandling of classified information.2. The unmasking of U.S. citizens in intelligence reports is a normal part of the intelligence community's process.3. There is no evidence of a conspiracy between the FBI, CIA, and DOJ to take down President Trump.4. The term "deep state" is often used to refer to a supposed cabal of unelected officials who secretly manipulate government policy, but there is no credible evidence that such a group exists.5. DACA is a program that allows certain undocumented immigrants who were brought to the United States as children to remain in the country without fear of deportation. It does not grant them legal status or a path to citizenship.6. "Drain the swamp" is a campaign slogan used by President Trump to promise to rid Washington, D.C. of corruption and special interests.7. "Walkaway" is a term used to describe individuals who have left the Democratic Party.8. "No DACA" is a stance against the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program.9.

	1. It's important for countries to secure their borders, but it's also crucial to respect human rights and international law.2. Orban's actions may be popular in Hungary, but they don't set a good example for the rest of Europe.3. The focus should be on finding long-term solutions to the root causes of migration, rather than just building walls and closing borders.

	I agree that illegal immigration is a complex issue, but it's important to remember that people are not illegal, they are human beings. Merit-based immigration can be a solution, but it should not be at the expense of human rights and dignity.

566	@user @user agree with your idea to use the army to build the wall do it hashtag buildthatwall hashtag buildthewall
	1. Using the military to build a wall goes against the Posse Comitatus Act of 1878, which prohibits the use of the military for law enforcement within the United States, except in certain circumstances.2. Building a wall is not a solution to the complex issue of immigration and border security.3. It's important to remember that immigrants, including those who are undocumented, are human beings and should be treated with dignity and respect.4. Instead of focusing on building a wall, we should be working on comprehensive immigration reform that addresses the root causes of migration and provides a pathway to legal status for undocumented immigrants.5. We should also be investing in technology, infrastructure, and personnel to secure our borders effectively and humanely.6. And finally, let's not forget that the United States is a nation of immigrants, and we should be welcoming people from all over the world who want to contribute to our society and economy.

	1. It's important to remember that not all immigrants are "bad elements." Many contribute positively to society.2. Building a wall won't solve the root causes of the issue, such as poverty, violence, and instability in their home countries.3. The cost of building and maintaining a wall is extremely high and could be better spent on education, healthcare, and other essential services.4. The U.S. has a long history of welcoming immigrants and should continue to do so in a fair and just manner.

	1. It's important to remember that not all immigrants are illegal, and not all illegal immigrants are from Hispanic or African descent.2. The economic impact of immigration is complex and depends on various factors, including the specific labor market conditions and the skills and qualifications of the immigrants.3. The term "socialist" is often used as a political label, but it's not clear how it relates to the issue of immigration in this context.4. The solution to the complex issue of immigration should be based on facts and evidence, not on fear or prejudice.5. It is important to have a comprehensive and humane immigration policy that addresses the root causes of migration, provides a path to legal status for undocumented immigrants, and protects the rights and interests of all communities involved.

	1. It's important to note that not all refugees are illegal immigrants. Refugees go through a rigorous vetting process before entering the country.2. The number of refugees admitted to the US is a humanitarian issue, not a budget one.3. The nine federal contractors mentioned in the tweet are non-profit organizations that help refugees resettle in the US. They play a crucial role in ensuring the successful integration of refugees into American society.4. Reducing the number of refugees allowed into the US would not only be a violation of human rights, but it would also harm these organizations and the communities they serve.5. It is essential to remember that refugees are human beings who have been forced to flee their homes due to violence, war, or persecution. They are not a threat to the US, but rather an asset to our society.Therefore, it is important to challenge the narrative that refugees are a burden and instead focus on the positive contributions they bring to our communities.

	1. The number of illegal immigrants in the US is estimated to be around 11 million, not 15 million.2. The allocation of congressional seats is based on population, not on immigration status.3. It's important to remember that people, regardless of their immigration status, are human beings and deserve respect and dignity.4. Let's focus on finding solutions that benefit everyone, rather than creating divisions and scapegoats.5. Building a wall is not a solution to the complex issue of immigration. Instead, let's work on comprehensive immigration reform that addresses the root causes of migration and provides a pathway to legal status for those who are already here.

60	@user for god sake dont put india to danger by unchecked appeasement of ur special community illegal migrants nation is supreme
	"Special community" and "illegal migrants" are not interchangeable terms. It's important to differentiate between individuals and groups based on their actions, not their ethnicity or nationality.Furthermore, "appeasement" is not a solution to the issue of illegal immigration. A more effective approach would be to address the root causes of why people are leaving their home countries and to work towards finding a fair and just solution for those who have already immigrated illegally.It's also important to remember that immigrants, regardless of their legal status, contribute to the economy and society in many ways. They are not a monolithic group and should not be stereotyped or stigmatized based on the actions of a few.Lastly, it's crucial to respect the rule of law and uphold the values of equality and justice for all, regardless of nationality or immigration status.

	1. It's important to remember that everyone is entitled to their own opinion, even if it may seem uninformed or ill-informed.2. Using derogatory language and name-calling doesn't contribute to a productive conversation.3. Let's focus on facts and evidence when discussing political issues, rather than personal attacks or insults.4. Building a wall may not be an effective solution to the complex issue of immigration.5. The DACA (Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals) program allows certain undocumented immigrants who came to the US as children to apply for a renewable two-year period of deferred action from deportation and eligibility for a work permit. It does not grant them legal status or a path to citizenship.6. The University of Illinois is a public research university located in Champaign-Urbana, Illinois, in the Midwestern United States. It is the flagship campus of the University of Illinois system.7. There is no credible evidence to support the claim that "thousands of Americans" are killed by "illegal aliens" every year. According to the Department of Justice, in 2018, there were approximately 45,000 crimes committed by non-citizens in the US

	1. Sanctuary cities are not against the law, they are cities that limit cooperation with federal immigration enforcement.2. Arresting and prosecuting governors and mayors for following their own policies would be a violation of their constitutional rights.3. It's important to remember that the vast majority of immigrants, including those protected by DACA, are law-abiding citizens who contribute positively to society.4. The Constitution guarantees protection against unreasonable searches and seizures, as well as the right to due process and equal protection under the law.5. Ending sanctuary cities and DACA would not make America great again, it would only create more division and fear in our communities.6. Congress should focus on comprehensive immigration reform that addresses the root causes of migration and provides a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants.

	1. Deportation is not a solution to crime, as the vast majority of undocumented immigrants are law-abiding citizens.2. Ending programs like DACA does not solve the issue of criminal immigrants, as it only affects those who came to the US as children.3. Building a wall will not stop illegal immigration, as people will find other ways to enter the country.4. Ending sanctuary cities and chain migration does not address the root causes of illegal immigration.5. Mandatory E-Verify is a step in the right direction, but it is not a complete solution.Instead, we should focus on comprehensive immigration reform that addresses the needs of both the immigrants and the US economy. This includes a pathway to citizenship for undocumented individuals, increased border security, and a fair and efficient legal immigration system.Let's work together to find a solution that benefits everyone, rather than spreading hate and fear. #ImmigrationReform #CompassionateSolutions #TogetherWeCan #EndThePolarization.

187	is the judge on crack? he said said govt needs to prove it considered the benefits of having illegal aliens here and working illegal immigration cost $135 b a year while illegals pay $8 b in taxes illegals are no benefit to the u s hashtag trump hashtag maga https://t co/9eervu5h7x
	1. It's important to remember that the judge's decision is based on the law and the facts of the case, not personal opinions or political affiliations.2. The cost of illegal immigration and the taxes paid by undocumented immigrants are two different things. The former refers to the financial burden on the government, while the latter refers to the revenue generated by their labor.3. The economic impact of illegal immigration is complex and multifaceted. While it's true that some costs are incurred, it's also important to consider the benefits, such as filling labor gaps in certain industries and contributing to the economy through consumption and entrepreneurship.4. The DACA program, which allows certain undocumented individuals who came to the US as children to remain in the country without fear of deportation, is a separate issue from illegal immigration as a whole.5. Ultimately, the debate over immigration policy should be based on facts, evidence, and a consideration of the long-term interests of the country and its people, rather than short-term political gains or fear-mongering.

615	@user why is it that illegals that have been in the u s for years that are being deported get to claim asylum when the laws states they must claim aslyum within one year of their last arrival ? stop allowng illegals to game the hashtag immigration s
	1. Not all undocumented immigrants are the same. Some may have entered the country as children and have lived here for many years, while others may have entered more recently.2. The asylum process can be complex, and there are many reasons why someone might not be able to file within the one-year deadline. For example, they may have been unable to leave their home country due to violence or persecution, or they may not have had access to accurate information about the process.3. The United States has a long history of granting asylum to people who have fled persecution or violence in their home countries. It is important that we continue to uphold this tradition and provide a safe haven for those who truly need it.4. It is also important that we address the root causes of why people are leaving their home countries and coming to the United States in the first place. By working to improve conditions in these countries, we can help reduce the number of people who feel they have no choice but to leave.5. Finally, it is important to remember that every person is an individual, and their situation is unique. We should not make assumptions about someone based on their immigration status or where they come from. Instead, we should treat each person with dignity and respect, and work to find solutions that are fair and just for

	1. It's important to note that the number of refugees Japan accepts is a result of its unique historical and cultural context.2. Comparing Japan's refugee policy to other countries is not a fair comparison.3. Refugees are not the same as economic migrants or illegal immigrants.4. Japan's approach may not be feasible or desirable for all countries.5. The focus should be on finding long-term, sustainable solutions to address the root causes of refugee crises.6. Every country has the right to determine its own immigration policies, but these policies should be based on compassion, human rights, and international law.7. Let's work together to find ways to support refugees and help them rebuild their lives, rather than stigmatizing and demonizing them.

	1. It's not only white countries that accept migrants.2. Countries have the right to decide their own immigration policies based on their resources and needs.3. We should focus on addressing the root causes of migration, such as poverty, conflict, and lack of opportunities, rather than blaming the migrants themselves.4. It is important to remember that every human being has the right to seek safety and a better life, regardless of their race or nationality.5. We should strive for a world where all people are treated with dignity and respect, and where everyone has access to the resources and opportunities they need to thrive.

Israel's decision to deport African migrants is a matter of national security and immigration policy.3. Ethiopia, like any other country, has the right to decide who enters its territory and under what conditions.4. It is essential to respect the human rights and dignity of all individuals, regardless of their nationality or immigration status.5. It is crucial to address the root causes of migration, such as poverty, conflict, and persecution, rather than just focusing on the symptoms.6.

The issue of refugees and migration is complex, and it's not a simple matter of "banning them from their territory."3. Instead, we should focus on finding long-term, sustainable solutions to address the root causes of migration, such as poverty, conflict, and persecution.4. We should also work to ensure that refugees are treated with dignity and respect, and that they have access to the resources and support they need to rebuild their lives.5.
