	I'd like to offer a different perspective. Mass migration can be a complex issue, and it's not accurate to attribute it solely to the Islamic world. Many factors contribute to migration, including economic instability, conflict, and climate change. Furthermore, a US war with Iran could lead to unintended consequences, such as increased instability in the region and a rise in extremist groups. Let's focus on addressing the root causes of migration and promoting peaceful coexistence, rather than resorting to simplistic or divisive rhetoric.

	Islam is a religion with over 1.8 billion followers, and like any other faith, it has a diverse range of perspectives and interpretations. To generalize that Islam as a whole is at war with itself oversimplifies the complexities of the issue.Moreover, the UK's decision to accept or reject refugees is a complex issue influenced by various factors, including politics, economics, and social considerations, not solely based on the religion of the refugees.

	I'm glad you brought this up. Let's talk about the complex history of the United States. You're right, the land that is now the United States was indeed originally inhabited by Native American communities. However, the idea that "our immigrant ancestors" simply "stole" the land is an oversimplification.The history of colonization and the displacement of Native Americans is a painful and multifaceted one, involving the actions of governments, corporations, and individuals. It's essential to acknowledge the trauma and injustices inflicted upon Native American communities and to recognize the ongoing struggles they face today.It's also worth noting that many Native American communities have been advocating for their rights and self-determination for centuries, long before the concept of "immigrant ancestors" was even relevant. Let's strive for a more nuanced understanding of this complex history and work towards a more inclusive and equitable future.

	Deporting people who have been living in the US for years, including those who came as children, is not a solution to the issues you're concerned about.

Let's use "undocumented immigrants" instead.That being said, the fact that some Americans may agree with you doesn't necessarily mean that the issue is as simple as you're making it out to be. There are many complexities to consider, such as the economic contributions of undocumented immigrants, their impact on local communities, and the moral obligation to provide basic necessities like food and shelter to those in need.It's also worth noting that homelessness among U.S. citizens is a multifaceted issue that requires a comprehensive solution, not a simplistic one that targets a specific group of people.

Labeling him as someone who "wants to make Europe a multicultural society" oversimplifies his views and ignores the complexities of the issue. It's also worth noting that a "multicultural society" can be a positive aspect of a country's identity, promoting diversity, understanding, and social cohesion.
