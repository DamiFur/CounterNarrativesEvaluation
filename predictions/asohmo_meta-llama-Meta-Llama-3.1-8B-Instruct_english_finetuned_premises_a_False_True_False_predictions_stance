The republicans, on the other hand, have made immigration one of their main issues, and it is clear that they are more concerned about "their" jobs and wages, which, by the way, are not even their own.

	Accepting immigrants is not a rich people thing, nor is it a white or black thing. It's a humanitarian thing. We are all equal before the law, and if the law says that immigrants have a right to enter, then they do. If you don't like it, you can change the law, but until then, stop complaining about something that is not your decision, and neither is it in the hands of the rich, or the white, or the black.
